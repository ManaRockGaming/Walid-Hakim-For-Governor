                <h1><b>Investing In Education and South Carolina's Future</b></h1>
                <p>Hakim believes that a strong state begins with strong education. Instead of cutting funding, South Carolina must <b>invest deeply in its schools and students.</b></p>
                <p>He proposes the creation of <b>“South Carolina College Investment Grants”</b> for students pursuing critical careers; such as nursing, medicine, engineering, education, social work, and therapy. Rather than burdening graduates with debilitating student loans, this plan allows them to repay the state through service. Every graduate who accepts a grant would commit to living and working in South Carolina for 10–20 years; as taxpayers, homeowners, consumers, and parents. Their contributions to the state’s economy and communities would serve as repayment for their education. This initiative would ensure that the <b>most educated and capable workforce in the world</b> lives right here in South Carolina, making its citizens highly sought after in every field imaginable.</p>
                
                <h1><b>Reshaping the School System</b></h1>
                <p style="padding: 0px 1%;"><b>Nutritious Meals for Every Student:</b> Every school in South Carolina would provide healthy breakfast and lunch to all students, ensuring no child goes hungry during the school day.</p>
                <p style="padding: 0px 1%;"><b>Statewide Childcare Integration:</b> Childcare would be incorporated into the state school system, giving working parents reliable and affordable early education options.</p>
                <p style="padding: 0px 1%;"><b>Year-Round Schooling:</b> Schools would transition to a year-round schedule. This program would not add any days to the school calendar. It would eliminate the need for student review at the beginning of every school year, allowing the students to transition to the next year without a long summer break. This would result in students graduating by the completion of the 10th grade.</p>
                <p style="padding: 0px 1%;"><b>Career and College Readiness:</b>Grades 11 and 12 would be transformed into trade school or associate degree programs, giving students a head start on their careers or higher education.</p>

          <p>Every classroom in South Carolina would be equipped with spring safety locking, <b>bullet-resistant doors</b>. These upgrades would protect students and teachers <b>without criminalizing young people</b> or perpetuating the school-to-prison pipeline. The discipline of students should be managed by the school administration and staff, unless law enforcement is requested. We do not need law enforcement inserting themselves when these situation can be resolved by school staff. Through smarter investment in infrastructure, education, and opportunity, Hakim envisions a <b>South Carolina where schools are safe, nurturing, and built for every child’s success.</b></p>

          <p>To quote the Mayor of Bogota, Columbia: “A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It’s where the rich use public transport.”</p>
          <p>Hakim believes this vision captures the future South Carolina deserves; a state where <b>public transportation is fast, clean, and free for all.</b> As Governor of South Carolina, Hakim would <b>contract the development of a high-speed rail systems</b> connecting the state’s major cities, creating a seamless network from Charleston, to Columbia, Atlanta, and many more.</p>
          <p>Complementing this effort, the state would introduce a fleet of <b>solar powered, no cost public buses</b> to transport citizens to and from work. This program would be designed to benefit both employers and employees; reducing parking needs, cutting road congestion, and <b>saving South Carolina hundreds of millions of dollars every year in infrastructure</b> and maintenance costs. Through these innovations, Hakim envisions a South Carolina that leads the South in <b>sustainable growth, smart design, and efficient mobility.</b> We need a state built for the people, not for traffic.</p>
        
        <h1><b>Limiting Property Hoarding</b></h1>
        <p>To keep housing affordable and communities strong, Hakim would <b>limit property ownership to ten residential properties per corporation or individual,</b> excluding apartment complexes.This policy ensures that <b>homes remain in the hands of residents, not investors,</b> preventing mass buyouts that drive up housing costs and displace families. By curbing speculative ownership, South Carolina can stabilize neighborhoods, lower rents, and make homeownership attainable again for working people across the state.</p>

For <b>$100 a month per individual or $200 per family</b>, South Carolinians would receive medical, dental, and vision coverage with <b>no deductibles, no co-pays</b>, and assistance for seniors, disabled, veterans, and low-income families.</p>
          <p>All licensed medical professionals would be required to accept the plan as in-network, and <b>new procedures would never be denied.</b> Every child born in South Carolina would be automatically enrolled for life.

We have failed the law enforcement community by not providing them with the tools they need to do their job on a daily basis. As Governor, Hakim would increase the training of all police officers to 18 months, giving them an opporunity to gain a degree in law enforcement, select on the job training, and to provide the support staff necessary. As Governor, he would hire one social worker for every ten sworn police officers, who would handle mental health emergenices and provide support to victims of violent crimes; this would allow police to concentrate on law enforcement and allow them to return to duty while the social worker support staff takes over victim services.</p>

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give ME your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"”</i></p>

          <h1><b>Rising Above the Culture War</b></h1>
          <p>Hakim believes that the so-called “culture war” is a deliberate distraction, designed to divide working people while the real issues facing South Carolinians go unaddressed. Debates over identity, symbols, and outrage-driven politics have become tools to keep citizens angry at one another instead of focused on the challenges that truly matter: wages, healthcare, education, housing, and the environment.</p>
          <p>As Governor, Hakim would not take part in that division. Instead, he would focus on practical progress—policies that improve daily life for every South Carolinian, regardless of background or belief. But refusing to engage in the culture war does not mean abandoning progressive causes. Hakim will continue to stand firmly for <b>civil rights, reproductive freedom, LGBTQ+ equality, environmental justice, and fair treatment for all people.</b> He understands that real progress does not come from shouting across political lines, it comes from lifting people up together.</p>
          <p>By turning away from division and toward shared prosperity, Hakim envisions a South Carolina where people <b>talk less about who to blame and more about what we can build</b> a state united not by ideology, but by purpose.</p>

          <p>As Governor, Hakim would implement a <b>Smart Gun Safety Policy</b> centered on secure background checks, mental health screenings, and required firearm safety training for all new gun owners. He would promote the use of smart-gun technology, such as fingerprint or PIN activation systems, to prevent accidental shootings and unauthorized use, particularly by children or criminals. Safe storage standards would be enforced for firearms in homes and vehicles, with incentives for owners who use biometric safes or other secure methods.</p>
          <p>Hakim’s plan also strengthens penalties for gun trafficking and straw purchases while expanding access to <b>violence prevention and mental health services</b> addressing the causes of gun violence before tragedy occurs. This policy protects the rights of law-abiding citizens while ensuring that <b>firearms are used safely, responsibly, and intelligently,</b> keeping South Carolina’s communities secure for generations to come.</p>
        -->
          <p>As governor of South Carolina, Hakim would offer grants for qualified citizens to purchase rifles for hunting or home protection. Each person would be required to take a gun safety course, submit to a background check, and evaluation to qualify for this voluntary grant. Military veterans and law enforcement would be excempt from the grant process, but can still apply. As a candidate, Hakim wants to make clear he has no intention of confiscating guns or implementing any additional restrictions that are in place. </p>

          <p>While we cannot predict the future, we can prepare for it. And while we prepare, we must build safeguards creating a South Carolina that’s worth saving, one that is safe for our grandchildren and does not sacrifice the tomorrows of the future for the indulgences of today.</p>
          <p>Hakim’s vision is to develop a 100 Year Plan for South Carolina: a roadmap for a sustainable, prosperous, and resilient state. This plan will invest in sustainable infrastructure that becomes the lifeline of commerce, trade, preserving South Carolina’s remaining forests as sanctuaries for native wildlife. We will evolve our state education so every student can graduate debt-free making South Carolina a national model for higher learning.</p>
          <p><b>With planning, we have hope. With hope, we have a chance.</b> With this last chance, we, the Green Party, will accomplish our goal of saving the future for generations.</p>
